# Fractal-Explorer
3D fractal explorer prototype in Unity.
Prototyping possible routes for deep zoom functionalities by passing minimum distance values from compute shader to c# script.

This has since been abandoned whilst I begin development on a 3D fractal deep zoom explorer using Arbritrary Precision Arithmetics with OpenGL - this does not seem well suited to Unity due to Unitys inbuilt limitations of transform value precision (although haven't fully decided on what platform to build the project yet, may well end up coming back to Unity if I can figure out a work around for the precision limitations).
